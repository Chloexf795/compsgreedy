# Dijkstra Algorithm Assignment

This assignment integrates ethics and real-world impacts into the learning of Dijkstra's algorithm. 

## File Structure
### Core Files
- **`main.py`** - Node and Edge classes with rideshare-appropriate attributes and cost calculation functions
- **`mn_dataset.py`** - Minnesota cities dataset with 25 cities featuring realistic rideshare attributes (traffic, parking costs, weather conditions, etc.)

### Files to implement
- **`part_a.py`** - Starter code for part A1 & A2
- **`part_b.py`** - Starter code for part B
- **`part_d.py`** - Start code for part D

### How to run your code
```bash
python3 part_a.py (replace this will file you intend to run)
```
This will show "not yet implemented" messages for all functions that you need to complete

## Dataset Features
The Minnesota dataset includes 25 cities with:
- **2 urban** (high traffic, expensive parking, high platform costs)
- **16 suburban** (moderate values) 
- **7 rural** (low traffic, cheap parking, higher fuel/maintenance costs)
- **Weather conditions** for safety testing (storm, snow, rain, clear)
- **32 road connections** representing major Minnesota highways
